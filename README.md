# Steganography
Online steganography API for PNG images. API encodes text into Base64 and embeds into Least Significant Bits of the uploaded image and generates a key in a form of integer number which is a bit lenght of the plaintext message.
See https://techriot.net:5000 to test the API and see the blog post about Steganography on https://techriot.net/index.php/2023/06/25/least-significant-bit-steganography/
